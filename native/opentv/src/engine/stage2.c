 * paid to avoid a *half* quantum of static detune, and the wobble is the more
 * audible of the two by far.  Spreading it on a fixed schedule only moves the
 * artefact to F0/k, and randomising when it is spent puts energy at every
 * modulation rate including the slow ones the ear hears as warble.
