             * a 1500 ms note steps down 6.6 dB two fifths of the way through
             * and sits there.  That step is heard as the next note arriving
             * early, which is exactly what it sounds like.
             *
             * So walk back out of the release first.  What the release moves
             * is not the amplitude -- track 0 holds its 60 right through --
             * but the three bandwidths, and it moves them abruptly: through
             * the note they drift about one a frame, and in the two frames
             * where the phoneme ends they go 94, 89, 83 and 163, 167, 171.
             * Stepping back while a frame differs sharply from the one before
             * it leaves that edge behind and lands on the note's own last
             * steady frame.  Eight frames is the most it will give up, which
