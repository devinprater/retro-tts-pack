/* Microsoft Sam / Mike / Mary text to speech: the library interface (for screen readers and other hosts).
 *
 * The same shape as the Microsoft Anna port's anna_tts.h, so one driver can talk to both engines.
 * Output is 22050 Hz (SAM_TTS_SAMPLE_RATE), 16-bit mono PCM, streamed through a callback as it is
 * produced.
 *
 *   sam_speech *t = sam_tts_open("path/to/voice-data", "Sam", err, sizeof err);
 *   sam_tts_speak(t, "Hello world.", 0, &callbacks);  // blocks until done or cancelled
 *   sam_tts_cancel(t);                                     // from any thread: stops the running speak
 *   sam_tts_close(t);
 *
 * The data folder holds <Voice>.spd and <Voice>.sdf (the voice and its base pitch) next to the shared
 * LTTS1033.LXA and r1033tts.LXA, as installed by the original Microsoft TTS voice package.
 *
 * Note on the name: the low-level engine header sam.h already has a sam_tts_speak_pcm() that takes a raw
 * PCM callback, so the library's is sam_tts_speak(). Everything else follows the anna_tts_*
 * spelling.
